# Linear-Discriminant_Algorithms

## Overview

To illustrate how different linear discriminant algorithms perform on a given data set. 
<pre>
The following algorithms are implemented using no algorithm-inbuilt library:

  1. Batch Perceptron Algorithm
  2. Iterative Perceptron Algorithm
  3. Pocket Algorithm
  4. Least Mean Square Algorithm using stochastic gradient descent
